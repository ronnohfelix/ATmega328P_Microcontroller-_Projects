# Optima CT540 Gantry Design

Welcome to the Optima CT540 Gantry Design project repository! This project involves designing the gantry for a proposed new CT scanner called Optima CT540 using Proteus simulation software and C language. Communication within the system is limited to UART at 115200 baud. The theory of operation is based on the information provided in the attached manual, specifically the section on "Gantry Theory Lightspeed 5.x".

## Features

- **Gantry Design**: The project focuses on designing the gantry for the Optima CT540 CT scanner, incorporating the theoretical concepts and specifications provided in the manual.

- **Proteus Simulation**: Utilize available resources in Proteus to simulate and design the gantry system.

- **C Language Implementation**: The code for the system is written in C language and includes the control logic for operating the gantry.

- **UART Communication**: Communication within the system is limited to UART at a baud rate of 115200.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

1. **Hardware**:
   - Arduino Uno or equivalent microcontroller.
   - Components available in Proteus simulation software such as motors, sensors, and other control elements.
   - Other necessary hardware such as resistors, diodes, and wires.

2. **Software**:
   - Arduino IDE for coding and uploading sketches to the Arduino Uno.
   - Proteus simulation software.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Setup**:
   - Unzip the provided zip file and locate the "index_frames.html" file.
   - Navigate to the theory section on the left and go to "Gantry Theory Lightspeed 5.x".
   - Familiarize yourself with the theory of operation outlined in the document.

4. **Designing the Gantry**:
   - Based on the "Gantry Theory Lightspeed 5.x" section, design the gantry system using Proteus simulation software.
   - Incorporate the necessary components such as motors, sensors, and control elements into the design.

5. **Software Implementation**:
   - Load the provided C code (`gantry_design.c`) onto your microcontroller using Arduino IDE.
   - Adjust the code as needed to operate the gantry according to the theory of operation.
   - Test the system in Proteus to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

6. **Operation**:
   - Monitor the operation of the gantry and adjust parameters as necessary.
   - Test the system thoroughly to ensure it meets the design specifications.

## Safety Precautions

- Handle all electrical components with care and follow safety protocols.
- Always work in a safe and controlled environment.
