# Airbus A320 Braking System Model

Welcome to the Airbus A320 Braking System Model project repository! This project aims to design a braking system model that mimics the actual system as accurately as possible, based on the A320 landing gear manual (pages 30 to 43). The project uses an Arduino Uno (Atmega328P) as the microcontroller and Proteus for the schematic simulation. 

## Features

- **Braking System Model**: The project models the Airbus A320 braking system, including sensors and actuators as necessary to replicate the real-world system's functionality.

- **Communication Protocols**: The model utilizes three communication protocols discussed in class to manage the interactions between different system components.

- **Code Implementation**: The code provided for the Arduino Uno includes the control logic for operating the braking system model and managing the sensors and actuators.

- **Schematic Simulation**: A Proteus schematic is provided to demonstrate the operation of the model. This includes the Arduino Uno, sensors, actuators, and other relevant components.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

1. **Hardware**:
   - Arduino Uno or equivalent microcontroller.
   - Sensors and actuators as required by the model.
   - Proteus simulation software.
   - Other components such as resistors, diodes, and wires.

2. **Software**:
   - Arduino IDE for coding and uploading sketches to the Arduino Uno.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. **Designing the Model**:
   - Review pages 30 to 43 of the A320 landing gear manual to understand the braking system in detail.
   - Choose appropriate sensors and actuators to model the braking system based on the manual.
   - Design a schematic in Proteus that includes the Arduino Uno, sensors, actuators, and any other components necessary to model the braking system.

4. **Software Implementation**:
   - Load the provided sketch file (`braking_system.ino`) onto your Arduino Uno using Arduino IDE.
   - Adjust the code as needed to operate the model according to the manual.
   - Simulate the operation of the model using the Proteus schematic.

5. **Operation**:
   - Test the model in Proteus to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
   - Monitor the operation of the model and adjust parameters as necessary.

## Safety Precautions

- Handle all electrical components with care and follow safety protocols.
- Always work in a safe and controlled environment.
