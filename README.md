# ATmega328P Microcontroller Projects

Welcome! This folder contains a collection of projects spanning various domains such as engineering, electronics, and consumer product design. Each project is documented with a detailed readme file outlining its goals, features, and instructions to help you get started. I completed these projects but still needs perfection.

## Projects Overview

1. **Chemical Flow Control System**:
    - Designs a system using Atmega328P and Arduino language to control the flow of chemicals to three storage tanks.
    - Manages the tanks using level sensors and pumps, with inputs fed through a keypad.
    - Incorporates safety features such as an emergency button.

2. **Temperature Control System**:
    - Implements temperature control in a house using noise filtering and PID control.
    - Uses AD592 temperature sensor, fan, and heater (oven model) to maintain a set point temperature of 22Â°C.
    - Provides a serial output to monitor the temperature after filtering.

3. **Airbus A320 Braking System Model**:
    - Designs a braking system model for Airbus A320 using Proteus and Arduino Uno.
    - Incorporates the theory of operation outlined in the manual for the A320 landing gear.
    - Manages sensors and actuators with PID control and UART communication.

4. **Optima CT540 Gantry Design**:
    - Designs the gantry for the proposed new CT scanner called Optima CT540.
    - Uses Proteus simulation software and C language to manage components and control the system.
    - Communication is limited to UART at 115200 baud.

5. **Improved Espresso Machine**:
    - Tasked with designing an enhanced espresso machine that outperforms existing market options.
    - Uses assembly language for programming to achieve fast and efficient performance.
    - Focuses on innovative design and user interface for a better customer experience.
